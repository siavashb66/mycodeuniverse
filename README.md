## About Me

I'm [Siavash Bakhtiarnia](https://bakhtiarnia.com), a coding enthusiast with a background in material science and a Ph.D. in Nanotechnology. This website is where I share my explorations in the universe of code, documenting my hobby projects and the lessons learned along the way.

## Projects

Dive into my universe of code, where each project is a new adventure:

- **Beyond Chance:** An engaging story that connects the probabilities and distributions of dice rolls to microscopic world of atoms.
- **Snowflake Secret:** An exploration into the beauty of fractals, rendered through code, and beautiful visualization of Koch snowflake and Koch anti-snowflake.

### You can visit jupyter notebooks in an interactive environment
