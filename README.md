## My Code Universe

I'm a coding enthusiast, eager to learn and explore the vast world of programming. Witnessing how computer simulations in movies like "Interstellar" can unlock scientific truths is truly inspiring. This website is my way of taking those first steps into this exciting world. Here, I'll be documenting my projects, some small, some hopefully growing in complexity, as I experiment, learn, and contribute to the larger programming community. The true purpose of starting "My Code Universe" is to learn from others along the way. As I grow my abilities, I aim to expand this space and foster a welcoming community for all code enthusiasts.

**About the Projects**

This website showcases my hobby projects in various stages of development. Some projects might offer explanations or tutorials alongside the code, while others might focus more on the code itself. The code is primarily written in Python, but I'm always open to exploring new areas and tools.

**Projects**

* **Dice Probability and Distribution of Sums:** This project simulates rolling dice and explores the probability of different outcomes and the distribution of the sums obtained.
* **Line Fractal:** This project delves into creating a mesmerizing line fractal using code.

**Contributing**

I am excited to learn from others and build a collaborative space! Feel free to contribute code, ideas, or tutorials by submitting a pull request on GitHub.
