Welcome to **My Code Universe**â€”a space dedicated to my personal coding projects and explorations in the realm of programming. Here, I share my passion for creating, learning, and experimenting with code.

## About Me

I'm [Siavash Bakhtiarnia](https://bakhtiarnia.com), a coding enthusiast with a background in material science and a Ph.D. in Nanotechnology. This website is where I share my explorations in the universe of code, documenting my hobby projects and the lessons learned along the way.

## Projects

Dive into my universe of code, where each project is a new adventure:

- **Dice Probability Simulator:** A Python-based tool that visualizes the probabilities and distributions of dice rolls.
- **Fractal Generator:** An exploration into the beauty of fractals, rendered through code.
