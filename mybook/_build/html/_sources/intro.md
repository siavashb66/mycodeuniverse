Imagine a world where the magic of movies helps us make real scientific discoveries. That's what happened with the film "Interstellar" directed by Christopher Nolan. The team, including a famous scientist named Kip Thorne, used computer simulations to create amazing scenes of black holes. But they did more than make a great movie â€“ they helped us understand how gravity bends light. This was a big deal for science, and it all started with the special effects in a movie. Computer simulations are like virtual labs. Scientists use them to test ideas in ways that might be too risky or costly in real life. For example, they can design new materials or study the stars and the universe. The creation of the "Double Negative Gravitational Renderer," the program used for "Interstellar," is a testament to the power of computer simulations. It's not just about making things look real in movies; it's about discovering truths in our universe. This program didn't just give us stunning visuals; it provided scientists with a new way to visualize and understand the complex forces at work around black holes. It shows us that computer simulations are more than just tools; they're gateways to unlocking the mysteries of science and the universe.

## About Me

I'm a coding enthusiast, eager to learn and explore the vast world of programming. This website is my way of taking those first steps into this exciting world. Here, I'll be documenting my projects, some small, some hopefully growing in complexity, as I experiment, learn, and contribute to the larger programming community. The true purpose of starting "My Code Universe" is to learn from others along the way. As I grow my abilities, I aim to expand this space and foster a welcoming community for all code enthusiasts.

## About the Project

This website showcases my hobby projects in various stages of development. Some projects might offer explanations or tutorials alongside the code, while others might focus more on the code itself. The code is primarily written in Python, but I'm always open to exploring new areas and tools.

### Contributing

I am excited to learn from others and build a collaborative space! Feel free to contribute code, ideas, or tutorials by submitting a pull request on GitHub. 

### Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions! You can find me at [https://bakhtiarnia.com/](https://bakhtiarnia.com/) where you can use the contact form to reach out. I'll be sure to get in touch with you as soon as possible.
