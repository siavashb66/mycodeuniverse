Imagine a world where the magic of movies helps us make real scientific discoveries. That's what happened with the film "Interstellar" directed by Christopher Nolan. The team, including a famous scientist named Kip Thorne, used computer simulations to create amazing scenes of black holes. But they did more than make a great movie – they helped us understand how gravity bends light. This was a big deal for science, and it all started with the special effects in a movie. Computer simulations are like virtual labs. Scientists use them to test ideas in ways that might be too risky or costly in real life. For example, they can design new materials or study the stars and the universe. The creation of the "Double Negative Gravitational Renderer," the program used for "Interstellar," is a testament to the power of computer simulations. It's not just about making things look real in movies; it's about discovering truths in our universe. This program didn't just give us stunning visuals; it provided scientists with a new way to visualize and understand the complex forces at work around black holes. It shows us that computer simulations are more than just tools; they're gateways to unlocking the mysteries of science and the universe.

## About Me

I am a coding enthusiast with a background in material science and a PhD in nanotechnology, eager to learn and explore the vast world of programming. My interest in Python programming sparked from a curiosity to explore its possibilities, particularly for materials modeling, despite being an experimentalist working in a laboratory. However, computers serve as different sorts of labs where we can explore concepts in ways almost impossible or too costly in real life.

What truly fascinates me about coding is the prospect of creating something tangible from mere characters in a text editor. Through Python, we can explore various computational setups and analyze data with newfound insight and efficiency.

The true purpose of starting “My Code Universe” is to share my enthusiasm and to learn from others along the way. Here, I’ll document my projects, ranging from small experiments to hopefully more complex ones, as I enhance my abilities. I aspire to expand this space and connect with fellow enthusiasts and learners who share my passion.

Together, let's explore the endless possibilities of programming and simulations, humbly learning from each other and embracing the joy of discovery in every line of code.


## About the Project

This website showcases my hobby projects in various stages of development. Some projects might offer explanations or tutorials alongside the code, while others might focus more on the code itself. The code is primarily written in Python, but I'm always open to exploring new areas and tools.
